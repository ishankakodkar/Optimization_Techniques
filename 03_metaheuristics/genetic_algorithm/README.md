# Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## Mathematical Background
Genetic Algorithms are population-based metaheuristic optimization methods inspired by natural selection and genetics. Solutions (individuals) evolve over generations using selection, crossover, and mutation operators.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions
2. Evaluate fitness for each individual
3. Select parents based on fitness
4. Apply crossover and mutation to generate offspring
5. Replace population and repeat

## Relevance
- Useful for non-convex, discrete, or combinatorial optimization
- Does not require gradient information
- Can escape local minima

## Applications
- Feature selection
- Scheduling
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Neural architecture search
