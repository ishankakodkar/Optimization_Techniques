# Convex Optimization Methods

This section contains algorithms and explanations for solving convex optimization problems, which are central to many fields including machine learning, operations research, and signal processing.

## What is Convex Optimization?
Convex optimization focuses on minimizing convex functions over convex sets. These problems have the property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, making them particularly tractable both theoretically and algorithmically.

## Key Techniques to Include
- Gradient Descent (for convex problems)
- Subgradient Methods
- Projected Gradient Descent
- Proximal Gradient Methods
- Interior Point Methods
- Linear Programming (Simplex, Interior Point)
- Quadratic Programming

## Recommended Literature
- S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, "Convex Optimization," Cambridge University Press, 2004. [[Book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)]
- D. Bertsekas, "Convex Optimization Algorithms," Athena Scientific, 2015. [[Book](https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/ConvexOptimizationAlgorithms.html)]

## Applications
- Machine learning model training
- Signal processing
- Resource allocation
- Portfolio optimization
