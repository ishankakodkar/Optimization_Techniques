# Linear Programming (LP)

## Mathematical Background
Linear programming is the problem of optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints:
$$
\min_x \ c^T x \quad \text{subject to} \ Ax \leq b, \; x \geq 0
$$

## Relevance
- Foundation of operations research, economics, and engineering optimization.
- Efficient, polynomial-time algorithms (Simplex, Interior Point).
- Basis for more complex convex and combinatorial optimization.

## Applications
- Resource allocation
- Scheduling
- Network flows
- Machine learning (e.g., support vector machines)
