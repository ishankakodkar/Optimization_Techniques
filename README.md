# Optimization Techniques in Python ðŸš€

Welcome to a comprehensive, hands-on repository for learning and implementing a wide array of optimization algorithms in Python. This project is designed to provide clear, well-documented, and practical examples of techniques ranging from basic gradient descent to advanced, specialized methods.

Each algorithm is organized into its own subfolder, complete with a detailed `README.md` explaining the mathematical theory (with references to seminal literature) and a Python file with a clean implementation.

## Installation

To run the examples in this repository, first clone it and then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by category to facilitate a structured learning path:

-   **`01_basic/`**: Foundational first-order and second-order methods.
-   **`02_advanced_gradients/`**: Adaptive and momentum-based gradient methods.
-   **`03_metaheuristics/`**: Population-based and probabilistic methods for global optimization.
-   **`04_constrained_optimization/`**: Techniques for handling problems with constraints.
-   **`05_specialized_techniques/`**: Advanced methods for specific problem structures (e.g., expensive or integer problems).
-   **`06_convex_optimization/`**: Methods tailored for convex problems.
-   **`07_derivative_free/`**: Classic methods that do not require gradient information.
-   **`08_multi_objective/`**: Algorithms for optimizing multiple, conflicting objectives.
-   **`09_stochastic_methods/`**: Advanced stochastic approximation techniques.

## Suggested Learning Path

1.  Start with **`01_basic`** and **`02_advanced_gradients`** to build a strong foundation.
2.  Explore **`06_convex_optimization`** for a deep dive into this powerful and well-understood class of problems.
3.  Study **`04_constrained_optimization`** to learn how to handle real-world constraints.
4.  Dive into **`03_metaheuristics`** and **`07_derivative_free`** for gradient-free approaches to complex problems.
5.  Finish with the advanced topics in **`05_specialized_techniques`**, **`08_multi_objective`**, and **`09_stochastic_methods`** to round out your knowledge.
